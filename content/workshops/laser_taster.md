This one-session Saturday morning class will introduce participants to medium-power laser cutting technology – how it works, the variety of materials that can be cut and/or engraved, relevant safety standards, how computer files can be prepared for cutting, sending a file to the laser-cutter and initiating the cutting and how much it all costs.

 - Date: Saturday 28th October 2017, 10.30-13.30
 - Course length: 1 morning
 - Price: £35 (£28 for students)
 - Tutor: Kevin Karney
 - Level: Beginner
 - Campus: Llandaff Campus, B Block

Participants will choose from one of three template designs that they will modify to their requirements, cut/engrave and go home with something they are made themselves.
 - a plywood handy box
 - a (faux-)leather coin wallet
 - a plywood name-plate for (e.g.) a child’s bedroom or a house name
These will be made on FabLab’s 40 watt & 60 watt CO2 Epilog lasercutters. (Materials will be provided.)

The aims of the course are:
 - to see what can be done with a modern technology like laser cutting.
 - to allow participants to make an informed decision whether to participate in the longer six-session “Building Laser Cutting Skills” course.

The session will include a very brief tour of all the other modern technologies available in FabLab. It will also provide options for accessing external laser-cutting services.

The course is open to adults of any ages/backgrounds and to children over 10-years old if accompanied by a supervising adult. Class size will be for a maximum of 8 participants.

Pre-requisites for the course – enthusiasm to make things and basic computer literacy (little more than mouse-and-keyboard experience)
