Basic skills to be learnt : Laser cutting of paper

Zhen Xian Bao - an old rural chinese tradition - were made for use in the home, to store the sewing accessories or other small flat items. They typically have an intricate paper folded design. The paper was often decorated with small pieces of fabric, coloured paper or pictures. This version has 15 different compartments and will be made from thick artist’s quality drawing paper .

Zhen Xian Bao make wonderful Christmas presents for special people, since one may decorate the book with material or art-work specific to the recipient.

In this short easy course, the intricacy of design is largely hidden by the ability to laser-cut paper with consistent accuracy. Participants, using already developed digital plans, will learn how to produce cut lines, and both back and forward folded lines using a laser. They will take home a completed Zhen Xian Bao book.

Course fees would include tuition, machine use and enough good quality paper to make one Zhen Xian Bao. Additional paper will be available to make a second thread book. Additionally some high quality Japanese decorating paper may be purchased.
If participants wish, they should bring along any fine patterned fabric material, which can be laser-cut to fit the paper book

The course is suitable for anyone who is reasonably handy. Adult-supervised teenagers welcome as single participants.
