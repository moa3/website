Basic skills to be learnt : Laser cutting of plywood.

In this short easy course, participants will learn the basics of precision laser cutting and take home a kit that they have laser-cut themselves. The kit will produce an automaton Welsh flying dragon with all the materials needed, including detailed assembly instructions. It is the kit - not the assembled product - that makes the Christmas present. Anyone, who is reasonably handy, and can follow instructions, can make the kit. Only glue, sandpaper and patience are needed.

The tutor will also demonstrate the assembly methods to ensure that the gift-giver can help the gift-receiver, if required.

Course fees would include tuition, machine use and enough laser-grade baltic-birch plywood and wire to make a single kit. Additional plywood at cost.

The course is suitable for anyone who is reasonably handy. Adult-supervised teenagers welcome as single participants.
